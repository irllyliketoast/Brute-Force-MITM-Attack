# Brute-Force-MITM-Attack
 I co-authored the article " Advanced Persistent Threats and WLAN Security: An In-depth Exploration of Attack Surfaces and Mitigation Techniques." My contributions focused on the attack surface analysis, where I conducted testing of man-in-the-middle and dictionary attacks on Wi-Fi networks, including the KRACK and Downgrade Attacks.
